    Notes
    -----
    As detailed in [Machado2020]_, this method is an approximation of sltcap.
    It has many limitations, most importantly, it does not perform well at very
    low concentrations where you end up with non-sensical values. To help
    users identify such possible cases, an warning is thrown if
    N0 / charge < 1 (as detailed in [Machado2020]_).

    Notes
    -----
    As detailed in [Schmit2018]_ and [Machado2020]_, there are several
    limitations to this method, the most notable of which are that this
    can only be used on monovalent ions. It is unclear as to how accurate
    this remains when dealing with structural ions (e.g. protein bound Ca2+).
    In this latter, case, our current approach is to treat the bound ion as a
    part of the solute (further validation is needed to verify this).
